is a preview tool for org mode /i.e./ ~.org~ file in neovim.

Recently I moved from markdown to asciidoc,
and made a preview for asciidoc
[[https://github.com/preview.adoc.nvim][preview.adoc.nvim]].

Just after finishing [[https://github.com/preview.adoc.nvim][preview.adoc.nvim]],
I learned the basic syntax of asciidoc.
And just after I learning the basic syntax of asciidoc,
I decided to give up asciidoc.
It vaguely displease me.

And then I tried restructuredText, and so on.
Finally, it comes to *org mode*.
